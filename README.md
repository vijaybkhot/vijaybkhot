## About Me üë®‚Äçüíª  

I am a passionate and dedicated Computer Science graduate student at Stevens Institute of Technology, with a strong foundation in software development, web development, and user-centered design. Transitioning from a background in civil engineering to technology, I bring a unique perspective to problem-solving, combining analytical thinking with creativity to develop innovative solutions.

With hands-on experience in full-stack web development, I have successfully delivered projects that integrate modern technologies such as Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, React, and Leaflet.js. I have a proven ability to create dynamic, scalable applications, as demonstrated through projects like Natours, ServiceEasy, and Campus Pulse. These projects showcase my expertise in RESTful APIs, secure authentication using JWT, payment integration via Stripe, and interactive front-end design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Beyond technical skills, I thrive in collaborative, Agile environments where I can contribute to cross-functional teams. My experience as a team coordinator in academic projects highlights my leadership, communication, and problem-solving abilities. I am proactive in learning, continuously enhancing my skills through advanced coursework and self-driven projects in machine learning, mathematical foundations, and AI technologies.

I am driven by a desire to build impactful, user-centric applications that solve real-world problems and enhance user experiences. My ability to empathize with users, coupled with my technical expertise, positions me as a well-rounded software developer eager to contribute to innovative teams.

My long-term goal is to specialize in UI/UX design and web development while leveraging cutting-edge technologies like AI to create intuitive and meaningful solutions. With a collaborative spirit and a proactive learning mindset, I am excited to take on challenging roles where I can continue to grow and make a tangible impact.
