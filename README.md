## About Me 👨‍💻  

Hi there! I’m **Vijay Khot**, originally from Kolhapur, India. My professional journey began in civil engineering, where I earned a strong academic foundation through a Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in the field. Over the years, I’ve contributed to impactful projects in the construction industry, including leading teams to execute government initiatives like the construction of **604 low-cost housing units** in Ichalkaranji, India.  

Driven by a passion for coding and creating innovative solutions, I made the leap to computer science and began my journey as a graduate student in August 2023. This transition has been both challenging and incredibly rewarding, allowing me to grow, learn, and evolve as a budding software engineer.
