## About Me 👨‍💻  

I am a passionate and dedicated Computer Science graduate student at Stevens Institute of Technology with a strong foundation in software development, web development, and user-centered design. Transitioning from a background in civil engineering to technology, I bring a unique perspective to problem-solving by combining analytical thinking with creativity to develop innovative solutions.

With hands-on experience in full-stack web development, I have successfully delivered projects that integrate modern technologies like Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, React, and Leaflet.js. My projects—Natours, ServiceEasy, and Campus Pulse—highlight my expertise in building dynamic, scalable applications with features such as RESTful APIs, secure authentication (JWT), payment integration (Stripe), and interactive front-end design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I thrive in collaborative Agile environments, contributing effectively to cross-functional teams. My leadership and communication skills are evident in my role as a team coordinator during academic projects. I am committed to continuous learning, advancing my knowledge in machine learning, mathematical foundations, and AI through coursework and self-driven projects.

I am driven by a passion for creating impactful, user-centric applications that address real-world problems while enhancing user experiences. My long-term goal is to specialize in UI/UX design and web development, leveraging cutting-edge technologies like AI to craft intuitive, meaningful solutions. I am excited to collaborate with innovative teams and contribute to projects that make a tangible impact.
