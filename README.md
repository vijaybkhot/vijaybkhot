*** About Me:
Iâ€™m Vijay Khot, originally from Kolhapur, India. My professional journey began in civil engineering after completing my Bachelorâ€™s degree from Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University (2008â€“2012) and an M.Tech in Construction and Management (2013â€“2015) from College of Engineering Pune. Over the years, Iâ€™ve contributed to impactful projects in the construction industry, including leading teams to execute government projects like construction of 604 low-cost housing units in Ichalkaranji, a town in India.

Driven by a passion for coding and creating solutions through technology, I decided to transition to computer science and started my Masterâ€™s journey at Stevens Institute of Technology in August 2023. This exciting shift has been challenging yet immensely rewarding, allowing me to explore, learn, and grow as a budding software engineer.
