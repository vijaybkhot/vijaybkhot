## About Me 👨‍💻  

Hi there! I’m **Vijay Khot**, originally from Kolhapur, India. My professional journey began in civil engineering after completing my **Bachelor’s degree** from **Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University** (2008–2012) and an **M.Tech in Construction and Management** (2013–2015) from **College of Engineering Pune**. Over the years, I’ve contributed to impactful projects in the construction industry, including leading teams to execute government initiatives like the construction of **604 low-cost housing units** in Ichalkaranji, India.  

Driven by a passion for coding and creating innovative solutions, I made the leap to computer science and began my **Master’s journey at Stevens Institute of Technology** in August 2023. This transition has been both challenging and incredibly rewarding, allowing me to grow, learn, and evolve as a budding software engineer.  

Feel free to explore my repositories as I work on projects that reflect my journey and interests! 🚀
